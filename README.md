# PowerBICapstoneProject
This is my Power Bi Capstone project as a part of Entry Elevate in which I have basically used various visualisation techniques available in the Microsoft Power BI. The report consists of tow pages namely Financial Report and Sheet 1 Report.
Data has been loaded from spreadsheet to the Power BI and preprocessing techniques like column quality checking, data reorganization, statistical function usage, etc have been performed.
The list include:
Stacked and Clustered Column charts , pie charts, Donut Charts, Treemaps, Line charts, Crads, etc which compares the sales data based on financial budgets ,profits, gross sales sum, etc and helps to analyse various trends.
A button,filter and Drill through button is made available to hop through the data made by different countries. A supporting table created for the same purpose.
Various formatting methods have been adopted for more eye-catchy experience.

Insights from the data  Financial Data Analysis:

Navigation Button ("Next Page"): This button suggests that this is one page of a multi-page report, allowing users to navigate to the next page.
Sum of Sale Price and Sum of Discounts by Product (Line and Column Chart): This chart shows the sum of sale prices and discounts for different products. The columns represent the sale price, while the line represents the sum of discounts. This visualization helps in understanding the relationship between sales price and discount levels for each product.

From Sheet 1 Report:

Sum of Sales and Sum of Gross Sales by Product (Bubble Chart): This bubble chart visualizes both the sales amount and gross sales by different products. Each bubble represents a product, with its size indicating the volume of sales or gross sales. The position of the bubbles can provide insight into which products have higher sales and gross sales.


Sum of COGS and Sum of Sale Price by Discount Band and Year (Stacked Column Chart): This chart displays the sum of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and the sum of the sale price categorized by discount bands (High, Medium, Low, None) over different years (2013 and 2014). It provides insight into the impact of different discount levels on sales and costs over time.

Data Table (Segment, Country, Units Sold, Profit): The table lists the sum of units sold, country, and sum of profit for different segments such as "Channel Partners" and "Enterprise." It provides detailed information on the performance of each segment across different countries, including profit and units sold.

Selection and Filter Pane: On the right-hand side, there is a "Selection" pane, which shows different elements of the dashboard (Drill, Table, Card, etc.), and a "Filter.

This dashboard is a comprehensive view that combines various data visualizations to analyze sales, profit, product distribution, and manufacturing price trends over different years and countries. The visualizations help users gain insights into different aspects of the data for better decision-making.
